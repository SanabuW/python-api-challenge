Python API call assignment for UCSD Data Bootcamp

## Project Overview
This repository is for the Python API call assignment for the UCSD Data Bootcamp.

The API of OpenWeatherMap, Google Places and Google Maps were used in two parts:
https://openweathermap.org/api

### Part 1
Make requests for 500+ data points on weather patterns based on locations and run regression analyses on various comparisons.

### Part 2
Make requests to the Google Places API to search for establishments based on longitude/latitude information, draw a Google map with markers for the establishments,
as well as a heat map reflecting humidity levels.
